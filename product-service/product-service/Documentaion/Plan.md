# 🛠️ Solo Dev Plan for E-Commerce Microservices

## 🎯 Phase 1 – Core Service (Product Service)
✅ Already started!  
Focus: Make **Product Service** fully feature-rich before cloning patterns.  

- [x] CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- [x] Search by name (ignore case)  
- [x] Pagination  
- [x] Sorting  
- [ ] DTOs to decouple API from entities  
- [ ] Validation (with @Valid, @Size, etc.)  
- [ ] Swagger/OpenAPI docs  
- [ ] Unit + Integration tests  

👉 **Outcome:** One polished microservice that can act as the template for others.

---

## 🎯 Phase 2 – Inventory Service
- Clone structure from Product Service  
- Implement APIs:  
  - `GET /inventory/{productId}` → check stock  
  - `PUT /inventory/{productId}` → update stock  
  - `POST /inventory` → add stock (admin)  
- Add validation (stock >= 0)  
- Add Swagger docs  

👉 **Outcome:** Separate DB + service for stock tracking.

---

## 🎯 Phase 3 – Order Service
- Implement APIs:  
  - `POST /orders` → create order  
  - `GET /orders/{id}` → get details  
  - `PUT /orders/{id}/cancel` → cancel order  
- Communication:  
  - Call **Product Service** → verify product exists  
  - Call **Inventory Service** → check + lock stock  
- Return detailed response with product + stock info  

👉 **Outcome:** End-to-end order creation flow.

---

## 🎯 Phase 4 – User Service + Security
- Simple **User entity** with roles (`ADMIN`, `USER`)  
- JWT authentication (login/register)  
- Secure Product + Inventory + Order endpoints  
- Admin-only for product creation & stock update  

👉 **Outcome:** Full secure API with auth.

---

## 🎯 Phase 5 – Cross-Cutting Features
- Centralized **GlobalExceptionHandler** in each service  
- Swagger docs in all services  
- Logging with `slf4j`  
- Configurations via `application.yml`  
- Dockerize services individually  

👉 **Outcome:** All services production-ready in containers.

---

## 🎯 Phase 6 – Communication & Events
- Introduce Kafka or RabbitMQ  
- Publish `OrderCreated`, `OrderCancelled` events  
- Inventory Service consumes these events to update stock  

👉 **Outcome:** Event-driven decoupling (but keep REST fallback for dev simplicity).

---

## 🎯 Phase 7 – Gateway + Deployment
- Add **Spring Cloud Gateway** for routing  
- Run all services with `docker-compose`  
- (Optional) Deploy to Kubernetes (minikube or cloud)  

👉 **Outcome:** One entrypoint for the API, scalable architecture.

# ⏳ Suggested Timeline (Solo)

| Week | Tasks |
|------|-------|
| 1 | Finish Product Service (CRUD, search, pagination, sorting, DTOs, validation, Swagger, tests) |
| 2 | Build Inventory Service (stock APIs + validation) |
| 3 | Build Order Service (sync communication with Product + Inventory) |
| 4 | Build User Service (JWT auth, role-based endpoints) |
| 5 | Add cross-cutting features (exception handling, logging, Docker) |
| 6 | Add async messaging (Kafka/RabbitMQ) |
| 7 | Add API Gateway + docker-compose deployment |

---

⚡ **Pro Tips (since you’re solo):**
- Don’t build all services from scratch at once → polish **Product Service** first, then clone structure.  
- Use **Postman + Swagger** for manual testing until automation comes.  
- Start with **REST communication** → add Kafka later.
